# Micro-servo-robotic-arm

The micro servo robotic arm is designed to work as a pick and place robot. <br> it uses 4 micro servo motor which act as actuators and 4 potentiometers <br> which control the rotation of the micro servo motors. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and <br> running on your Arduino Board for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on Arduino.

### Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE installed on your PC
- Basic knowledge on Arduino programing 


### Installing

- Head over to https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software <br> download the Arduino IDE and install it.
- Download a copy of this project and open it with Arduino IDE.


### Connections and Working

- connections are done as ahow in the diagram image
- Power the Arduino and the servo motors separatly
- Rotate the potentiometers to control the movement <br> of the Robotic arm.
